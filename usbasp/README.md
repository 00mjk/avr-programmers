Perhaps, most popular programmer at the World. Build with AVR chips and a few others components. Work fine with AVRDude, under Linux, of course. Here we have a schematic sheet of this electronic circuit:

Under folder [drawings](https://github.com/majsterklepka/avr-programmers/tree/master/usbasp/drawings "drawings") we have some more drawings & in PDF format too.Of course, in this folder I have included completed project of that programmer. It was made with KiCad, an Open Source EDA Software package. Here, below we have PCB layout:

At the end, have a fun with that project and be patient, because these project need that at all.

I will be forgotten! Original firmware doesn't compile anyway, make print errors and I made some changes into source code, I think it will work!
