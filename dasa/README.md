# Device AVR Serial Adapter (dasa)
electronics workshop

As in title, simple, cheap and easy to build. Programmer using the RS232 port, working with AVRDude. Below 3D view of PCB layout:

To build, you need a few components:

- 3 x resistor 0.125W each 3k3
- 1 x resistor 0.125W 100 Ohm
- 8 diodes 1N4151
- 1 polarized capacitor 10u/16V
- 1 barrel DC connector
- 1 IDC-10 female connector
- 1 DB9 connector
- prototyping laminate or own PCB(make with Gerber files from gerbv/ folder)

Schematic Sheet is also in PDF format, included from drawings/ folder

Programmer works well with AVRDude, under Linux, Windows and MacOS.

Here, we have a PCB Layout view:

Have a fun with that project! Make better AVR's projects.
