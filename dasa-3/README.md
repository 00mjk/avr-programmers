# Device AVR Serial Adapter
electronics workshop

I present You a DASA-3, Programmer using a RS232 port. Programmed device must be powered from own circuit, not from programmer. What you need, to build this circuit? A few component:

- 3 x resistors 4k7
- 1 x resistor 10k
- 2 x Zener Diode 1N4733A
- 1 x transistor NPN BC546
- 1 x IDC-6 connector
- 1 x IDC-10 connector
- 1 x DB9 male connector

Here we have a 3D view of PCB:

I create project of PCB, all things I done with use of KiCad. Below, is that picture from discussed project. For create all documentation I have used Open Source Software & License used for publish project documentation are Open Source too. I use GNU GPLv3 license, for that. Here we have a PCB layout:

Project files, included Gerber files are inside this folder. I will be very glad if you use it for yourself satisfaction or in yours jobs. Feel free and share them with your friends
